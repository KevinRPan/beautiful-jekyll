With the new year arrived, it's the [ideal time][freshstart] to prioritize goals for the best 2016 possible! 

For myself, instead of a list of goals, I have one. I most want to discover my reason for being - my [ikigai][ikigai-wiki]. ([Ikigai story][ikigai-story])

Without knowing what we are truly hoping for, it seems that we may just be drifting purposelessly through life. 

Knowing my purpose and source of satisfaction will guide me through becoming what I want to be. [As explained by Robert Greene][mastery], "If you allow yourself to learn who you really are by paying attention to that voice and force within you, then you can become what you were fated to becomeâ€”an individual, a Master."

What do you think your ikigai is? 

A shoutout to my friends using a line I found: "Your friends are long term adventures, and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life and life to your years."
