Best, and only, office sport: Foosball! 

My very first game, I had a rude awakening of losing without scoring a point. 

I decided I wanted to get better, and to do that, I wanted a way to measure.

I created a score log of my personal games to rank myself compared to other players (my coworkers).

How could I tell if I was getting better though? Comparing wins and losses were not equal across players. 

I decided to apply the Elo ranking system used in chess and sports like soccer, football and basketball. 

This analysis allows any players to add their scores in a Google Doc, and all singles games go into creating a ranking for any player with match data available.
