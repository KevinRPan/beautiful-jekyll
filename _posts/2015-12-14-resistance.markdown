Staying focused is a vital part of achievement. 

But what to stay focused on?

One question to ask: "What *in me* do I need to change in order to achieve my goals?"

The importance of the question is in what it doesn't ask. It doesn't ask us to identify any external obstacles, but rather focuses on figuring out what we can do to help ourselves. 

Even when it's not a pressure situation, it helps to be able to overcome the resistance that blocks us from achieving the goals we have.
