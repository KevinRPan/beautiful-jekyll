## Welcome

Welcome to my blog. I'm inspired by the many many others like it, but these are my thoughts and ideas (if not mine originally, at least those on my mind).

I believe that we all have a role in making society more empathetic, our lives more sustainable, and useful technologies more advanced. It is imperative to find what moves us, that is, what we can contribute to make the world a better place to live in together. 

My background is in studying how certain mathematical truths can be applied to solve various problems. I am enthusiastic about solutions built in this way, from designing a program that automates a tedious or difficult task, to understanding a dataset for a data-driven answer.

Data visualization can be a powerful way to understand the significance of data by highlighting particular patterns and correlations.

This can help to illustrate a set of data in a picture worth many words, but can also [highlight spurious correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) or mislead if used incorrectly.

In our modern world where data abounds, it is interesting to see what we can make of it. Data literacy is increasingly important and in this blog I will post some of my explorations. 

The path to a better world seems to come in leaps and bounds, and the next revolution would seem to be the computing one with general applications of artificial intelligence. That is not to say there aren't huge developments happening in other fields, such as personalized medicine, smart homes, and blockchain. Hopefully I'll be covering some of these topics as well.

## Summary

My goal here is to make data-supported posts about what I find interesting. I aim to post at least one thoughtful piece a month.
