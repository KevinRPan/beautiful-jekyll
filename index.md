With inspiration from Hadley Wickham and Edward Tufte, I love data exploration and visualization. See the [projects](/projects) page for some things I've enjoyed making.

I am interested in and currently am working on:
- Data mining
- Data visualization
- Statistics
- Machine learning
- Blockchain technology

**Work:** I currently work as a Research Analyst at The Brattle Group in San Francisco. My day job involves preparing [analytically rigorous solutions that are thoughtfully developed and clearly communicated](http://brattle.com/), mostly using economic and statistical analysis in R to answer questions for litigation. 

**Education:** As an undergraduate, I studied math, statistics, computer science and economics at the University of Pennsylvania. An example project I worked on is with [natural language processing](https://github.com/KevinRPan/Yummly).

**Hobbies:** When offline, I enjoy travel, lifestyle photography, and snowboarding. I am a self-improvement addict and always trying to optimize.
