With inspiration from Hadley Wickham and Edward Tufte, I love [data exploration](/kiva) and [visualization](https://kevinrpan.shinyapps.io/euro_soccer_analysis/). Check out my [Github](https://github.com/kevinrpan/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kevinpan) or the [projects](/projects) page for some things I've enjoyed making.

I am interested in and currently am working on:
- Data mining
- Data visualization
- Statistics
- Machine learning
- Blockchain technology

**Work:** I currently work as a Research Analyst at [The Brattle Group](http://brattle.com/) in San Francisco. My day job involves preparing rigorous economic and statistical analyses, often used for litigation. For previous jobs, see my [resume](/img/Resume_KP_2018_01_16.pdf) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinrpan/). 

**Education:** As an undergraduate, I studied math, statistics, computer science and economics at the University of Pennsylvania to understand how to create and interpret useful models for various phenomena. I credit my interest in behavioral economics to my experience in research working for Katherine Milkman and Hengchen Dai in the Wharton School. 

**Hobbies:** When offline, I enjoy travel, [lifestyle photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinpan), podcasts, [thought-provoking reads](https://www.goodreads.com/kpan), crosswords, [electronic](https://www.last.fm/user/Soundshot) [R&B](https://open.spotify.com/user/1258277215) [beats](https://soundcloud.com/kpan), and snowboarding. I am also a serial optimizer.
