Some organizations I've consulted for (outside of my work with Brattle) are BUILD and Bernoulli.

### BUILD 
#### [Delta Analytics](http://www.deltanalytics.org/)

For [BUILD](https://build.org/), the question to answer is are we improving the academic and professional outcomes of our students? 

See more about this project in the [Delta blog](https://blog.deltanalytics.org/asking-the-right-data-questions-a14cb37dc177).

### Bernoulli One
#### [Wharton Digital Health Club](https://groups.wharton.upenn.edu/wdhc/about/)

*Early detection of critical events saves lives.* Yet throwing too many alarms leads to [alarm fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24153215) for doctors and nurses, which can result desensitization to alarms and missed alarms. 

So, given patient data streams for key indicators, how can we better understand the interaction of health indicators to detect critical events more accurately? 

This is where I stepped in with data mining techiniques (time-series, PCA, decision trees, auto-correlations, cross-correlations) to identify which indicators were useful predictors of the factory standard health index, and which were triggers for the majority of alerts. 

Our presentation to the executive team also described the levels of reduction in alert/critical alarms by decreasing the default indicator thresholds to varying degrees.
