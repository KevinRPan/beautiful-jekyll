This is a summary page for some side projects I've been working on.

## Development
I am excited to be currently helping develop a data science/machine learning course for underserved communities, such as non-profit or other social good learners.

### Machine Learning Course
#### [Delta Analytics](http://www.deltanalytics.org/)

How can *you* use data for good? Helping to provide foundational theory and coding to translate data into actionable insights for everyone. See more at the [Delta Analytics Machine Learning for Good page](http://www.deltanalytics.org/curriculum.html).

## Consulting
Some organizations I've consulted for are BUILD and Bernoulli.

### BUILD 
#### [Delta Analytics](http://www.deltanalytics.org/)

For [BUILD](https://build.org/), the question to answer is are we improving the academic and professional outcomes of our students?

### Bernoulli One
#### [Wharton Digital Health Club](https://groups.wharton.upenn.edu/wdhc/about/)

*Early detection of critical events saves lives.* Yet throwing too many alarms leads to [alarm fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24153215) for doctors and nurses, which can result desensitization to alarms and missed alarms. 

So, given patient data streams for key indicators, how can we better understand the interaction of health indicators to detect critical events more accurately? 

This is where I stepped in with data mining techiniques (time-series, PCA, decision trees, auto-correlations, cross-correlations) to identify which indicators were useful predictors of the factory standard health index, and which were triggers for the majority of alerts. 

Our presentation to the executive team also described the levels of reduction in alert/critical alarms by decreasing the default indicator thresholds to varying degrees.
